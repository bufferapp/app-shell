# @bufferapp/app-shell

Buffer's shared App Shell for our front-end applications. ðŸš€

## Installation

```bash
npm install @bufferapp/app-shell
```


## Usage

ðŸš© **You should be able to drop this component into your apps, replacing the old AppShell.**

There are no API or breaking changes.

For now, refer to [the old documentation for `@bufferapp/ui/AppShell`](https://bufferapp.github.io/ui/#/ui/ui/appshell) until we migrate docs here.
