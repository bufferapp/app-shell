# @bufferapp/app-shell

Buffer's shared App Shell for our front-end applications. üöÄ

## Installation

```bash
npm install @bufferapp/app-shell
```


## Usage

üö© **You should be able to drop this component into your apps, replacing the old AppShell.**

```jsx
// ‚ùå Change this
import AppShell from '@bufferapp/ui/AppShell';

// ‚ùå Or this
import { AppShell } from '@bufferapp/ui';

// ‚úÖ To this
import AppShell from '@bufferapp/app-shell';
```

There are no API or breaking changes.

For now, refer to [the old documentation for `@bufferapp/ui/AppShell`](https://bufferapp.github.io/ui/#/ui/ui/appshell) until we migrate docs here.


## Contributing

* Clone this repo and make your changes.

```
git clone git@github.com:bufferapp/app-shell.git
```

* Ensure your editor is setup for ESLint and Prettier.
* Make and test your changes locally (docs for this TBD, contact @hamstu in the meantime).
* Make a pull request and have it reviewed and merged into `main`.
* Now, from the `main` branch:
  * `git pull`
  * `npm run build`
  * Update [CHANGELOG.md](/CHANGELOG.md)
  * `npm version [patch|minor|major]` - pick one depending on type of changes
  * `git push origin main` - push changes to GitHub
  * `npm run publish` - publish the new version to NPM

## Local development

- You will need to run the API Gateway and login services on `buffer-dev`: `./dev up api-gateway login`
- Run `yarn watch` in this root directory
  -  This will watch for changes on both packages: the `app-shell` and the test `app`, and will render the test app in https://appshell.local.buffer.com:3000.
- In the near future, we'll also add some Storybook to be able to render parts of the AppShell (or all of it) in isolation from any other logic so that we can focus purely on UI development (setup TBD).

### Troubleshooting

If you spot any issues with your local setup, ping @msanroman any time!

This is likely a local session issue. Heading to https://login.local.buffer.com and signing up should make it work!

#### I get a DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN when trying to load https://appshell.local.buffer.com:3000

This is likely that you don't have the domain on your `/etc/hosts` file. Updating your `buffer-dev-config` setup and running `./dev up` again should 
fix it!
